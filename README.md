# BASKET CASE
## Open-source Turn-key DIY Eurorack Modular Synthesizer Case

BASKET CASE is an open-source design for a 12u 84hp Eurorack modular synth case. The name refers to the idea that the case can be built by essentially filling an online shopping basket. Despite its all-aluminum construction, it can easily be made without the use of special tools or equipment. The primary goal in designing this case was to create a freely available set of instructions for a turn-key DIY case that can be assembled from a minimal number of parts, obtained from a minimal number of sources. All of the digital files required to build the case, including the open source license information, are hosted at https://github.com/xoxomodular/basketcase
